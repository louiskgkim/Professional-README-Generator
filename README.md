# Professional README Generator

## Description

Node.js application that helps users generate a professional README file.

A lot of people tend to overlook a README file. Either the user.developer is lazy or they just do not know the proper syntax for the file. With the use of the generator the user/developer do not have to worry about either of them and create the file at ease.

Based on specific questions answered by the user, a complete professional README file will be created based on those answers.
